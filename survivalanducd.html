<h1> Is user-centred design survival of the fittest? </h1>
    <p>
        As it‘s the height of summer, something ancestral in me just wants to watch nature videos. A favourite of mine is anything by Ray Mears. Aa bit of a blast from the past but Ray Mears is a British bushcraft and survival expert who has hosted a number of popular television shows on the subject.
Over the last few years I’ve been refining my craft and skill around user research and design. And this lead me to think — what are the similarities between the very physical-old bushcraft and very conceptual-modern user centred-design?
Well as it stands Ray’s shows and other survival documentaries, can offer valuable insights for practitioners of user-centred design!
You cannot underestimate the importance of preparation. Ray Mears
Understanding the context you are in
One of the key lessons that can be learned from Mears and other survival experts is the importance of understanding the context in which a product or service will be used. This means taking into account the physical, cultural, and social environment in which the product or service will be used, as well as the needs and goals of the people who will be using it.
In a survival situation, for example, understanding the local climate, terrain, and available resources is crucial for ensuring that the tools and techniques being used are appropriate and effective. Similarly, in user-centred design, it is important to understand the context in which a product or service will be used, including the needs and goals of the users, as well as the technical and environmental constraints that may impact its use.
Being adaptable
Another key lesson from Mears and other survival experts is the importance of adapting to changing circumstances and being open to new ideas and approaches. In a survival situation, flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing conditions are essential for success. The same is true in user-centred design, where the needs and preferences of users may evolve over time, and it is important to be open to changing course and trying new approaches in order to meet the evolving needs of the users.
Iteration
Finally, Mears and other survival experts also emphasize the importance of testing and iterating on ideas in order to improve their effectiveness. In a survival situation, this may involve experimenting with different techniques or tools to see what works best in a particular context. In user-centred design, this can involve testing prototypes or early versions of a product or service with users in order to gather feedback and refine the design based on their experiences.
Obviously, user research and bushcraft are different. But sometimes it’s important to think about how different disciplines challenge and support each other. I’m looking forward to how my mind wonders in autumn!
